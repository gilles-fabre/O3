O3 : Programmable RPN Calculator

O3 (Operand Operand Operator) is a free and open source RPN Calculator. 

O3 can be programmed and support graphical capabilities. It includes a full featured
debugger which can be used to follow a script execution and fix its defects.

O3 provides user with the basic operations, plus all the java math functions, obtained through 
inspection, and hence keep up to date with the java jdk evolutions. 

O3 maths capabilities can also be extended by creating scripts and script functions (functions 
defined in scripts).

To discover O3 to the full extent (scripts, variables, arrays, graph drawing, etc), just read thru 
its About section.

Basically, O3 is a full featured scientific calculator wrapped into a simplistic GUI, in opposition 
with all these very complicated HP like calculators.

Feel free to use, modify, or whatever you want with this code as long as the o3 and jflex 
copyrights go along with the code/binary.
